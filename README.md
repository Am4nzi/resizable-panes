# Resizable Panes: Before and After

A minor project I complete during my time at Spiced Academy [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/), a coding bootcamp in Berlin, where I studied Full Stack Web Development.

This project developed my knowledge of JQuery, with a focus DOM manipulation and using event handlers.
